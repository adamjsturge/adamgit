# adamgit

Adam git is a really bad (but useful for me) way to use git. Certain git commands which are very common and come up a lot are aliased to short versions to save time.

Most used example for myself
gcommit which is git commit --amend --no-edit so you can save a lot of time

It also has branch management included. Will probably work on a way to not have this in the future. So when you make a push to your branch with either gup or gpush you won't need to type in the branch name or the whole push command

# Known issues
When you close the terminal it loses which branch you were on so you can easily break it by not having your branch there. Will work on a fix
