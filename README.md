# adamgit

Adam git is a really bad (but useful for me) way to use git. Certain git commands which are very common and come up a lot are aliased to short versions to save time.

Most used example for myself
gcommit which is git commit --amend --no-edit so you can save a lot of time

It also has branch management included. Will probably work on a way to not have this in the future. So when you make a push to your branch with either gup or gpush you won't need to type in the branch name or the whole push command

| Commands | What it does | Arguements |
|---|:------:|:------:|
| gadd | Adds files | None |
| gcommit | Git commit amends with no edits | None |
| gup | Push Branch to origin and current branch | None |
| gpush | Force pushes to origin and current with lease | None |
| gout | Checks out branch | Branch name |
| gmap | Maps new branch and changes to it | Branch name |
